title: Removing #[specta::specta] macro
hidden: true

# Why?

`#[specta::specta]` was intended to be a generic function exporting system but i'm not sure it has really panned out. It is only used by Tauri Specta and it bakes in Tauri/Tauri Specta assumptions which don't make it as fit for a generic system.

# Removing it?

We could:
 - Move it to `specta_functions` crate
 - Move it to `tauri_specta` crate
 - Remove it entirely?

# Remove it?

We currently use the `#[specta]` macro to collect type information from functions but what if we could just infer it using Rust?

Rust allows infering the types of functions using traits similar to the following:

```rust
