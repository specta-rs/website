title: Vanilla
---

The vanilla client allows you to consume your API on the frontend. This client is the minimal core and it is recommended that you use the [React](/client/react) or [Solid](/client/solid) integration for building application.

To get started first install the minimal runtime package.

```bash copy
npm i @rspc/client
```

Next you need to export the Typescript bindings from your `rspc::Router` by using either [export_ts_bindings](/server/router#exporting-the-typescript-bindings) or [export_ts](/server/router#exporting-the-typescript-bindings).

```rs /export_ts_bindings/ copy  filename="src/main.rs"
let router = <rspc::Router>::new()
  // This will automatically export the bindings to the `./ts` directory when you run build() in a non-release Rust build
  .config(Config::new().export_ts_bindings("./bindings.rs"))
  .build();
```

Then you can use the `@rspc/client` package to consume your API.

```ts copy filename="index.ts"
import { createClient, FetchTransport } from "@rspc/client";
import type { Procedures } from "./ts/index"; // These were the bindings exported from your Rust code!

// You must provide the generated types as a generic and create a transport (in this example we are using HTTP Fetch) so that the client knows how to communicate with your API.
const client = createClient<Procedures>({
  // Refer to the integration your using for the correct transport.
  transport: new FetchTransport("http://localhost:4000/rspc"),
});

// Now use the client in your code!
const version = await client.query(["version"]); // The types will be inferred from your backend.
const userOne = await client.query(["getUser", 1]);
const userTwo = await client.mutation(["addUser", { name: "Monty Beaumont" }]);
```

# Transports

rspc has multiple different transports which can be used. These dictate how the frontend is able to talk with the backend.

## Fetch Transport

<Callout>Fetch transport does not support subscriptions!</Callout>

Transport is built on the standard [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.

<details>

<summary>`GET` or `POST`?</summary>

rspc uses:

* `GET` requests for queries
* `POST` requests for mutations

<Callout type="warn">
**Important:** While rspc primarily uses `GET` requests for queries,
it may also use `POST` requests for queries in certain scenarios (similar to how GraphQL operates).
**Mutations will always use `POST` requests and will never use `GET`.**
This behavior is an implementation detail and **isn't guaranteed** to remain the same in the future.
</Callout>

</details>

```ts /FetchTransport/ copy filename="index.ts"
import { createClient, FetchTransport } from "@rspc/client";
import type { Procedures } from "./bindings.ts"; // The bindings exported from your Rust code!

const client = createClient<Procedures>({
  transport: new FetchTransport("http://localhost:4000/rspc"),
});
```

### Custom Fetch implementation

```ts copy filename="index.ts"
import { createClient, FetchTransport } from "@rspc/client";
import type { Procedures } from "./bindings.ts"; // The bindings exported from your Rust code!

const client = createClient<Procedures>({
  transport: new FetchTransport(
    "http://localhost:4000/rspc",
    // Include Cookies for cross-origin requests
    (input, init) => fetch(input, { ...init, credentials: "include" }),
  ),
});
```

## Websocket Transport

Transport build on the standard [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) API. This uses HTTP GET and POST requests under the hood.

```ts /WebsocketTransport/ copy filename="index.ts"
import { createClient, WebsocketTransport } from "@rspc/client";
import type { Procedures } from "./bindings.ts"; // The bindings exported from your Rust code!

const client = createClient<Procedures>({
  transport: new WebsocketTransport("ws://localhost:8080/rspc/ws"),
});
```
