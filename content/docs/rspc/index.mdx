rspc is a typesafe router for Rust which allows you to build end-to-end type safe APIs by generating a typesafe client to call the server from another language.

### Features

- ✅ **Typesafety** - move fast and **eliminate** a whole class of common bugs
- ✅ **Transport Agnostic** - expose your router via [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), [Tauri](https://tauri.app) or any other official or custom transport.
- ✅ **Performance** - small runtime footprint so your can get the **full potential of Rust's speed**
- ✅ **Middleware Ecosystem** - easily extend your procedures with **auth, logging and more**

### Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why would I use rspc over my existing web framework?">
    Due to rspc's opinionated nature we are able to push the boundaries of developer experience and optimisations which a regular web framework is not able to.
    Although many of rspc's features can be achieved with a regular web framework your going to end up with compromises or end up reinventing rspc instead of building your application.

    Big features:
     - End to end type safety as a first-class feature.
     - Client libraries to make calling your server from another language easy.
     - Ecosystem of middleware for abstracting common patterns.
     - Better compiler errors
     - Potentially better performance due to batching and single flight mutations.

  <Accordion title="Why would I use Rust instead of Typescript?">

    Although programming language choice is generally informed by the requirements of the project and the team's experience
    a lot of common reasons come down to the way Rust's strong type system, performance and low-level control allow you to build reliable and fast software that is able to stay maintainable for a long time.
    rspc is great as your primary API, a microservice or even embedded into your desktop application making working with your Rust backend a breeze when you need it.
