description: Rust crates for building better web apps
---

With specta-rs we are setting out to build an ecosystem of crates which enable developers to build better web apps with Rust. We are doing this by building libraries with a focus on:

**Typesafety**: types should always be inferred end-to-end, allowing you to move quickly and collaborate while maintaining confidence that your code is correct.

**Developer experience**: obsessed with simplicity, while maintaining flexibility. We build tools that make doing the *"right thing"* the *"easy thing"*, freeing you up to focus on the things that matter.

**Modern practices**: embrace the world of modern JavaScript tooling, enabling you to ship better user experiences than server-driven approaches.

**Scale**: build codebases that scale sanely, both in performance and maintainability. Take advantage of Rust's compile-time checks and tooling to reduce risk when developing large-scale applications.

## Why Choose Rust?

We are focused on building tooling in Rust but it is not always the right choice for your project. Rust has a lot of advantages such as it's **strong type system**, **tooling**, **high-performance**, and **memory safety** which leads to fewer runtime bugs and makes refactoring and maintaining code easier.

The right choice often depends on your situation:

* Server-side rendered UI frameworks often necessitate part or most of your backend to be in Javascript.
* Libraries like [Effect](https://effect.website) can bring Rust-like benefits without changing languages.
* Go has a lower learning curve and great standard library but has weaker error handling and type-checking guarantees resulting in more unreliable codebases.

Rust is the right choice if:
* Your team has Rust expertise
* Your building a microservice, your frontend is an SPA or your embedding your API into a native application (Eg. [Tauri](https://tauri.app))
* Your API needs to do heavy data processing, simulations or work where performance is critical.
* Your API needs to do processing where reliability and security are critical (Eg. banking, healthcare)
